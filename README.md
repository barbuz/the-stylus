### Development Setup

2. **Set up local server:**

### Version Management

The app version is managed in `sw.js` at the top of the file. When making changes that should trigger a service worker update:

1. Update the `APP_VERSION` constant in `sw.js`
2. This changes the service worker file, causing the browser to detect a new version
3. The version is fetched and parsed by `main.js` and displayed in the app footer
4. Users will see an update banner prompting them to reload
